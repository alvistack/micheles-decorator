Description: Decorators for Humans
 The goal of the decorator module is to make it easy to define
 signature-preserving function decorators and decorator factories. It
 also includes an implementation of multiple dispatch and other niceties
 (please check the docs). It is released under a two-clauses BSD license,
 i.e. basically you can do whatever you want with it but I am not
 responsible.
